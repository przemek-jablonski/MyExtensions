# MyExtensions
(Work in heavy development)

Collection of Kotlin extensions I use all the time for Android Development. Getting tired of copying it from project to project, so I figured I gonna drop this here and make a library out of it.

roadmap:
- set up project and it's gradle files for library distribution
- hook up jitpack.io
- make flavors (so that you can include only those extension groups that are of interest to you)
- make flavors distributable
